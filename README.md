## Abstract
The project analyzes four datasets to decide which is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on how easily and conveniently you can get to a place that is fun and you are sure to have a good time. Parks are one of the best locations that guarantee a good time to people across all age groups, thus the datasets 'playgrounds' and 'courts' are analyzed and result in Highland Park at first position and Allegheny Commons/Schenley Park at second position for best parks. Next, neighborhoods are examined to determine which neighborhoods are closest to those two parks, revealed to be Manchester and Lincoln-Lemington-Benmar. Finally, the choice between the two is decided by which neighborhood has the most reliable public transportation, which ends up being Manchester.
